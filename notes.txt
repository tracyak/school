Abstract Data Types

- work with pointers

Stacks; LIFO
- only 1 entry and exit point (at the top of the stack)
- can push, pop, peek items in a stack
- two pointers, basePointer (to start of the stack) and topPointer (to the top most item of the stack)
- when pop, check if there are any items in the stack
- when push, check if stack is full or not
- expectations:
	- initialise a stack using array
	
	stackArr = [None for _ in range(10)]
	basePointer = 0
	topPointer = -1 #because there are no items on the stack yet
	stackful = len(myArr) - 1

Queue; FIFO
- two types of queue, linear and circular
- 1 entry point (at the end of the queue), 1 exit point (at the start of the queue)
- keep track of length of queue to ensure we cannot dequeue an empty stack
- for linear queue, shift all elements to occupy the new free space but this is too expensive and time-consuming
- hence, we use circular queue, where rear pointer resets to 0 when it goes out of bound but size is not full when enqueueing a new element
- also where front pointer resets to 0 when it goes out of bound but size is not empty when dequeueing an element

Linked List; data and its pointers
- when adding an element, it is added to the start of the list
- when 

Trees; nodes with 3 pointers
- rootPointer points to the top of the tree(first element added)
- each node can have 2 child nodes, left child and right child (this is called a subtree)
- can be represented by a 2D array

Big O notation:
- O(1) Constant
	- The algorithm requires the same number of instructions to be executed, regardless of the size of the input data.
- O(n) Linear
	- The time taken for algorithm to be carried out varies proportionally to the size of the input data.
	- implementing linear time involves the use of iteration(a single count-controlled loop)
	- e.g. linear search
- O(n^2) Quadratic(Polynomial)
	- The time taken for algorithm to be carried out is proportional to the square of the size of the input data.
